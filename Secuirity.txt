Types of cyber attack
1. Active Attack
{
	Reading of data,
	Can modify data,

	types=> {
			masquarade,
			Relay,
			DOS (Multiple request to the server, unnecessary rquests from one source, scripts or virus containing files is run on the brackground of a device), 
			DDOS (Multiple request to the server, unnecessary rquests from more than one source, more storng than DOS Attack)
		}		
}

2. Passive Attack
{
	Read only, 
	traffic analysis (can know hosts, bytes, ),
	Can not modify data
}


Machine to Machine Communication or M2M {
	Different between machine to machine communication and IOT. Its architecture.
	How big data and iot is related or connected.
}

AI {
	
}

ML {
	Machine learning falls under AI.
	Algorithms => {Random Forest, Dicision tree, NetBase}	
}

DL {
	Deep learning falls under ML.
	RNN, STM
}

AI and then ML and then only DL.
Difference between IOT and AI, ML, DL.
