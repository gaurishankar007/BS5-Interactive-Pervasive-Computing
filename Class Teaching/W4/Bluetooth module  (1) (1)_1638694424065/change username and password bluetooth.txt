change name and password of Hc05/hc06 bluetooth module
............................................................

1:upload blank code first
2:connect the pin 
Module - TX pin -- Arduino TX pin
Module - RX pin -- Arduino RX pin
Module - GND pin -- Arduino GND pin
Module - 5v pin -- Arduino 5v 
3:make high enable en pin or key pin or wakeup pin (first disconnect ardunio from usb and  press button near en or key pin, while pressing join usb cable to laptop and leave
it observe led will blink differently)
4:check on serial monitor select both nl and cr and bud rate 38400

in serial monitor for HC-05
.........................................
first type AT+PIN1234 IN CASE OF HC06 only
type AT and it will return OK
to check name of the board AT+NAME
to change name of the board AT+NAME=anyname
to check password AT+PSWD
to change password AT+PSWD=anynumber


FOR HC-06
......................................................

upload blank code first

connect the pin 
.........................................
Module - TX pin -- Arduino RX pin
Module - RX pin -- Arduino TX pin
Module - GND pin -- Arduino GND pin
Module - 5v pin -- Arduino 5v 

check on serial monitor select both nl and cr and bud rate 9600
type AT and it will return OK
AT+PIN1234 CHANGING PIN
AT+NAMEdevicename for changing name

For HC06: Just connect the Rx of module to Tx of usb-ttl converter and Tx of module. Connect ground and Vcc.
The module is in AT mode. Didn't see that one coming, right? :P Turns out HC06 module is permanently configured to be slave and it is always in AT mode
 when not paired to any other device.
 So there is no confirmation led blinking that it is in AT mode like HC05 has. 
Just power up the module and pass the AT commands to modify the default settings.
